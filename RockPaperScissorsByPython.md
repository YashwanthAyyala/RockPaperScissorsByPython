Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:

This Python project implements a simple command-line version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Overview:

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has three possible outcomes: a draw (if both players choose the same shape), a win (if one player's shape defeats the other), or a loss (if one player's shape is defeated by the other). This project simulates the game against the computer.

Features:

Interactive command-line interface.Randomized computer choice.Simple logic for determining the winner.Option to play multiple rounds.
